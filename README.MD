# CardLife Alt Launcher
This launcher is designed to allow you to patch and play CardLife without EasyAntiCheat (EAC) getting in the way. This is very much a work in progress!

## Limitations
You must have a CardLife account through the standalone Launcher. Steam accounts will be supported when someone gets around to figuring out how best to make that work.

Official CardLife servers will NOT be accessible due to the lack of EAC.


## Response from Mark Simmons
On 2017-07-25, CardLife-Zhang sent an email to Mark Simmons at FreeJam, asking about the possibility of making modifications to CardLife. The same day Mark responded, and the response that CardLife-Zhang received is as follows:

> Regarding your question. We are OK with anyone in the community making any 
> modifications to CardLife that they wish as long as the following core 
> rules are followed:

> 1 - These modifications are free and not monetized

> 2 - These modified versions do not circumvent the user needing to buy an original copy of the game via Steam

> As long as this is the case we are happy.

Thus all development must be on this basis. Thank you Mark @ FreeJam!
